CSS Foundations landing page project

Key features i used includes:

- HTML5 Semantics: Utilizing appropriate HTML5 elements for semantic structure.
- CSS Styling: Applying CSS properties for styling, including colors, fonts, and backgrounds according to the spec-sheet we were given.
- - - - - - -  while researching to solve some alignment issues I found some information on button animation so the buttons are animated. 
- Flex-box Layouts: Employing flex-box to efficiently arrange and align elements within containers, enhancing the page layout.
- Playful Tech Humor: Incorporating lighthearted tech-related humor into the design for a unique user experience.
